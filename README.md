# Python 3 Coinflip experiment

Yair had an idea he would like to test, assuming you have a coinflip bet, 
what is the best strategy to win assuming losing streaks are statiscally uncommon.
we decided to test the following:

- bet on amount X
- if you lose bet is: X * 2
- if you don't have enough money bet everything (all in)
- if you win bet X

# How to run

- Clone this repo 
- run: 
```bash
python3 coinflip.py <number of time to place a bet>
```

example:
```bash
python3 coinflip.py 100
```
